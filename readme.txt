== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin violate Mr. Crawford's and Newrider's copyrights? =

I have absolutely no idea. However I have sent an email to the publisher and asked them to take a look. Haven't heard from them yet, so I guess they are all right with it.

= Half the lessons don't make sense to me... What do they mean? =

Please read "Chris Crawford on Game Design" (New Riders Publishing 2003). It's brilliant and this plugin is just meant to keep the book in mind.
